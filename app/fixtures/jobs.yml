      Responsible for automating everything from A to Z using Terraform, Ansible, AWS lambda functions, etc. I was responsible for supporting team of SREs in monitoring the platform using logs, metrics, tracing, amongst other observability stacks such as ELK and NewRelic. I advised product teams on topics such as automation and architecture. I aimed to enhance teams in regards to communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and infrastructure stakeholders in the software delivery lifecycle.
      While at Personio I migrated their web services into Kubernetes in AWS using GitLab. I created and managed a GitLab service in an automated fashion. I used the GitLab instance to provision Kubernetes environments in AWS. I migrated all microservices to Kubernetes services in AWS environment using direct connect.
      I aimed to improve their existing platform concerning scalability, deployments and reliability so they require less maintenance in the future. I supported the internal team on operations topics regarding deployment & automation. I provided training sessions for keen developers to attend regarding Docker & Kubernetes.

      During my time at Freeletics I was responsible for running their heavily used platform to sustain the api/web services 24x7x365. I completed this by monitoring the platform to know of issues before users and proactively responding to maintain the system.
      While at Freeletics, I introduced KOPS (Kubernetes Operations) to manage Kubernetes. Previously, the cluster had been created 'by hand' to use a combination of flannel/AWS route tables to manage internal networking. I improved the cluster design by; enabling load distribution across multiple availability zones in AWS, replacing a hardcoded ingress service with a dynamic ingress controller, fixing several security issues, reducing operating costs and, most importantly, provided the ability to autoscale the number of servers required by the cluster based on the current demand. The launch script for the cluster was also documented as a repeatable script (that ran inside docker) that could create a new Kubernetes cluster by; calculating available subnet CIDRs in a VPC, generating required keys/certificates, updating DNS records, defining all required resources in terraform, setup networking using Weave and initializing a helm tiller to await for future deployments.
      I created a helm chart that described all micro-services to be done as a single deployment . This improved the workflow by ensuring that the same versions and configuration settings (routing, Memory/CPU, etc) would be deployed on all production/staging/QA environments. It also enabled the teams to use HTTPS & subsequently HTTP2 for all environments.
