      <p>I migrated the Unlockbootloader website from a 3rd party hosting provider to AWS. We set up Jenkins to manage automated deployments to provision quicker releases. I configured metrics to be collected in Prometheus to monitor the application. I also created a service for developers of the LifeLog API to generate and manage their keys by using the API from APIGee.</p>
      <p>I created an Unlockbootloader service plugin and assisted in automating security PEN test audits. The audit reports helped to detect security flaws as soon as possible. I configured metrics to be collected in Prometheus to monitor the application on dashboards everybody could see which provided a strong feedback loop and allowed to Benchmark & review performance.</p>
