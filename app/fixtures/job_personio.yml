      One of the main implementations that I made early in the AWS migration project was related to the delivery pipeline.
      I implemented a procedure for the application to be deployed automatically to AWS for any changes made to the application.
      I was then able to use this as a platform for training developers from my experience about docker & delivery pipelines.
      This early training opportunity allowed me to build a report with developers whom I would later be working with to gather technical requirements from them.
